# FlashPay App

Welcome to FlashPay, your new React Native project for a cutting-edge mobile payment application. This project is set up using `@react-native-community/cli` for a seamless development experience. Follow the steps below to get started and explore the possibilities of this app.

## Getting Started

**Note:** Before proceeding, ensure you have completed the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

To initiate the JavaScript bundler, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Keep Metro Bundler running in its terminal. Open a new terminal from the project root and execute the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should soon see your app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

## Modifying Your App

Now that your app is up and running, let's make some changes:

1. Open `App.tsx` in your preferred text editor and edit as desired.
2. For Android, press <kbd>R</kbd> twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux, <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes.
3. For iOS, press <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload and view your modifications.
